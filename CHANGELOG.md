# Changelog

All notable changes to **OpenLearn V2** (platform package `openlearn-next`) are documented here.

> Versioning note: the platform `openlearn-next` is versioned independently of
> `@openlearn/plugin-sdk` (currently **3.4.1**) and `@openlearn/plugin-test-kit`.
> Bumping the platform does not change the SDK / test-kit versions.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.1.11] - 2026-07-25

### Features
- **Plugin system (P7-A2)**: complete the unified plugin runtime refactor — wire real
  capabilities into `PluginCapabilityGateway`, integrate plugin lifecycle via unified
  facades, surface unified plugin facades (`IPluginLifecycleManager`,
  `IPluginDistributionManager`, `IUnifiedExtensionRegistry`, …) into
  `PlatformServiceRegistry`, and expose them through `@openlearn/plugin-sdk`. (#e435bba, #475e9e1, #163b1fe, #6b8153e, #1b13eba)
- **User menu & profile**: collapse the top-right username / secure-logout area into a
  circular avatar button with a dropdown (Profile / Logout); profile modal supports
  editing the display name; password-change flow added (teacher + student). (#f818550, #86e7e25, #4fd9e91)
- **Class list summary**: class management list now shows per-class summary chips —
  student count, course count (schedules), assignment count — without expanding the row. (#4451d5b)
- **Dashboard Activity Center**: live in-progress status, pause/resume and
  enter-classroom controls, light theme. (#bfecccc, #e1d9ecb)
- **Class roster**: add list view mode and grid layout. (#05ea25e)
- **Navigation**: optimize platform navigation with grouped categories, badge support,
  and a registry adapter. (#2242613)
- **Routing**: reflect the active page in the browser address bar via hash routing. (#506f617)
- **Docs**: official documentation architecture upgrade to a 25-folder taxonomy; refactor
  the plugin-development AI Skill guide to the latest V2 architecture. (#7e62138, #cd31c3a)

### Fixes
- **Dashboard Activity Center**: resolve perpetual loading of the widget. (#cca16b9)
- **plugin-sdk build**: externalize npm dependencies in the SDK bundle so it no longer
  throws `Dynamic require of "path"` at runtime. (#b50392e)

### Chores / Docs
- Purge non-system plugin artifacts and clean up the plugin build manifest
  (remove quiz-pro and other purged plugin entries). (#1b71c21, #690c704, #1ff7f59)
- Bump `@openlearn/plugin-sdk` references to **3.4.1** and document the P7-A2 unified
  plugin services; publish `@openlearn/plugin-sdk@3.4.0`. (#5070506, #7d04c73)
- Add platform foundation audit report, navigation (PF-02) audit report, and a
  documentation quality review report. (#2e9b494, #c4ee1c8, #c272d6f)
- Purge obsolete historical sprint reports / RFC drafts and synchronize docs with the
  implementation. (#1b5662c, #543bd17)
- Add Plugin System Refactor Proposal (P7-A2). (#c53bd3d)

## [0.1.10] - 2025

Baseline release. System-wide version numbers harmonized to 0.1.10 and
`@openlearn/plugin-sdk` to 3.3.1. (#4d1069a)
